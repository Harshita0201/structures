/* Q-Add a variable of type enum etype (see Exercise 6), and another variable of type struct
date (see Exercise 5) to the employee class of Exercise 4. Organize the resulting program
so that the user enters four items of information for each of three employees: an
employee number, the employeeâ€™s compensation, the employee type, and the date of first
employment. The program should store this information in three variables of type
employee, and then display their contents. */
